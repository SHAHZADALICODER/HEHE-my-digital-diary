        content: `Hello! My name is Shahzad Ali — born on June 20, 2008 — and I’m turning 17 this year. Online, many people know me as “Shazzu” — especially in communities like Roblox, Discord, and other places where I’ve built and explored creative worlds.

This blog is my digital space. A place to write freely, think deeply, and store the thoughts I’m often too shy to say out loud. I’ve gone through a lot of internal changes recently — not just growing physically, but emotionally too. The way I look at the world, relationships, my future, and even myself has been evolving.

I’m a self-taught developer, filmmaker, storyteller, and someone who deeply believes in creativity. But at the same time, I’m also navigating the pressure of school, family expectations, and figuring out my true purpose.

This blog is not just for others — it’s also for my future self. A place to leave traces of how I felt, what I learned, and what I dreamed at this stage of my life. Whether I’m talking about deep emotions, coding, game design, or random midnight thoughts — it all belongs here.

Welcome to my mind. Welcome to HEHEHE: My digital diary. (System detected : Need to be updated)`,

        content: `I started this blog to have a space where I can express myself freely. In a world where social media often feels like a performance, I wanted a place that’s just mine. A place to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences without the pressure of likes or followers.

        This is my own digital diary, where I can write about anything that comes to mind. Whether it’s about coding, game design, personal growth, or just random thoughts, this blog is my sanctuary. It’s a space where I can be myself, reflect on my journey, and connect with others who might feel the same way.
        I also wanted to document my growth and changes over time. As I navigate through life, I find that writing helps me process my thoughts and emotions. It’s a way to understand myself better and to keep track of my journey.
        I believe that writing helps me understand myself better. It’s a way to process my thoughts and emotions, and to document my growth. This blog is not just for me, but also for anyone who might find comfort or inspiration in my words. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can connect with others who are on similar journeys.`,

        title: "Nowdays.",
        content: `These days, I feel like I'm completely cooked -- like my soul is being slowly roasted by life itself. Not burned suddenly, but simmered quietly, one painful moment at a time. And I'm just sitting in it, watching it happen, knowing I can't explain this feeling to anyone in my family or around me -- not in a way they'd understand.

It started when I failed my recent entrance exam. Someone junior to me -- not by age, but by class -- got selected. It broke me a little inside. I was the one who used to rank highest in my earlier school years. I was the one who made my family's expectations climb sky-high. But since Class 9, I feel like I've been falling constantly, and no one really sees how far I've fallen -- not even me sometimes.

It's been year after year of pressure. Class 9, then a 9th-grade entrance test. Then 10th board exams, followed by the 11th entrance test, then intermediate first year, then another entrance again -- and now, 12th is knocking on my door. The pressure has been nonstop, but what's more painful is that I haven't been able to meet my family's expectations in any of these years.

I know what they think now. They don't have to say it. The way they look at me, the way they speak to me -- I feel it. And it stings harder than words.

I'm a sensitive person. Even the smallest comment can stay with me for days. But I've learned to hide it. Because if I show pain, I'll hear things like:
"You're crying like a kid? Grow up already!"

So, I just take it in quietly.

There's someone in my family who thinks he can read minds. He'll ask questions that sound innocent, like "What's 5 + 5?", but his actual intention feels like something else entirely -- like he's silently judging me through trick questions. It's hard to explain, but it makes me feel small.

I gave the 11th entrance exam twice. Failed both times. Wasn't selected. That still hits deep. And today, someone from that room where I used to live while preparing for that exam -- not from my old class, just another student like me -- came to my village and called me to meet.

But whenever someone from that phase of my life calls me, I get this weird fear. It's not about them -- it's about the environment they bring with them. The rough tone, the abusive jokes, the way you're expected to talk like them to prove you belong. I can't do that naturally. I don't even know how to speak like that in my own language. I used to force myself to match their vibe, but not anymore. I've decided -- if someone's energy matches mine, I can talk with them all day and night. But I'm done pretending just to be accepted.

I'm the youngest in my family -- the youngest brother among all my siblings. I'm 17 now, but I don't even get the basic respect that a 14-year-old deserves.

If I try to do something by myself, they say:
"You don't have the brain for this, why did you even try?"

If I wait for their instructions instead, they say:
"You can't even think for yourself?"

So what exactly am I supposed to do? Everything I do seems wrong, no matter how I approach it.

Lately, something strange has started happening almost every midnight -- around 12 to 1 AM. I suddenly feel like I've lost something... but I don't even know what. It makes me feel like crying, but I don't know why. My mind starts playing back every painful moment I've ever had -- the times I felt humiliated, embarrassed, hurt -- like a cursed playlist on repeat.

And then, there's my body. I'm not very handsome, I know. I'm overweig--, and people feel the need to remind me of it daily.----

"What are you eating these days?" they laugh.
I laugh too, but inside, I feel broken. I didn't ask for this body. And I surely didn't ask to be judged by it every day.

I have dark skin too. And sometimes, I avoid laughing in front of people. Because when I look at myself laughing in the mirror, my face feels... weird. Like a dried egg or something. Not in a funny way -- in a way that makes me feel like others will find me disgusting if I smile too wide. So, I try to stay quiet. I don't want anyone to think I'm mocking them or being weird.

Outside of my family, even when I know people, I can't talk to them freely. My vibe is just different. People expect you to talk like a "cool" guy, using bad words in casual conversation like it's a lan--age. I can't fake that anymore. I don't want to.

Once, I overheard my mother telling her sister:
"He has no heart."
Maybe she said it because I fight with my siblings, or I raise my voice sometimes. But I do have a heart. I feel deeply. I feel things that maybe no one even notices. And it hurts knowing that my own mother might not see that.

Another time, my brother asked me:
"If you were lost in a jungle with some children and found an apple, would you eat it first or feed them first?"
I don't know what he was trying to test. Did he really think I don't care about others?

Sometimes I feel like my family has built an image of me in their minds that I don't even recognize. I don't know who they think I am. But it's not me.

And all of this -- the pressure, the judgments, the loneliness, the unspoken pain -- it has started to feel like depression. I know what's causing it, but it still feels heavier than what those reasons should normally feel like. It's like I'm carrying more weight than I'm built for.

I'm not writing --is to act cool or look like some tragic character. I'm not writi-- this for sympathy or attention. I'm not the saddest person in the world -- and I know that. I'm just trying to say honestly what I'm feeling these days. That's it.

My Urdu teacher once told us:--
"When you write down your pain, it absorbs some of the weight. Some of the pain stays on the page instead of in your heart."

I didn't believe that at first. But I tried it.

And it helped.

That's why I'm writing this on my blog. Not to impress anyone. Not to make anyone feel sorry for me. Just to speak honestly. To let it out. To give some peace to the mind that stays awake every night, haunted by the past.

I've written everything I feel these days. Maybe I'll change or add something later. But for now, I'm going to publish this on my blog and wait for my future self to read it. I don't know who I'll be then -- but I hope that version of me is doing better than the one writing this today.`

        title: "My Mood Swings.",
        content: "I don’t really know how to describe my mood these days. It’s true that I’m creative, which is why I named this post 'My Mood Swings.' When it comes to creativity, I can confidently say I’m a computer programmer—I can design websites, games, and apps. But that’s not all; I’m also a graphic designer, whether it’s 2D or 3D, and I can make animations and videos too. \n\nThe problem is: I can’t focus on one thing at a time. I’m constantly flooded with new ideas and projects, but I rarely finish them. I start something, get extremely excited, and then after a few days, I lose interest. My mind jumps from one thought to another, and I can’t seem to settle down. Still, I know I have the potential to do something great—if only I could find a way to stay focused and motivated. I want to use my creativity to build something meaningful—something I can be proud of. \n\nRight now, I’m just trying to understand how to manage my mood swings and bring balance into my life. Maybe someday I’ll look back and laugh at this phase, but for now, it’s just a part of who I am. Sometimes, I *do* manage to control it—like the time I developed and published two mobile games on the Play Store. But now? I’ve lost interest in fixing or updating them. I’ve made videos with my nephew, started app projects, and other things—but left them halfway. \n\nNow let me tell you how I even got into programming in the first place, and how it all started when I was just 14 years old. \n\nThe story begins in 6th grade. Our annual exams were approaching—but then, COVID-19 hit. Everything shut down. We were locked inside our homes. I installed Free Fire and started playing it non-stop. I got *so* addicted that I used to play it all day and night without even touching my books. I didn’t have a phone of my own, so I used my father's phone whenever he came home from work. It wasn’t just me—my entire village was hooked on that game. \n\nOne evening, while I was waiting for my father to return home so I could play, a *random thought* hit me. (I’ll talk more about my random thoughts in another post.) That thought was: \"How does the creator of this game feel, seeing thousands of people addicted to something he made?\" I didn’t think about the money he was making—I just imagined what it must feel like to create something that powerful. \n\nThat thought stayed with me. Without considering the difficulty or requirements, I decided then and there: I want to create a game like this—something people will love, something that might even become addictive.\n\nI borrowed my brother’s laptop and began searching on YouTube: “How to make a game.” I had absolutely zero knowledge of programming or what a game engine was. After watching several videos, I came across a channel named Sunny Gamedev (still subscribed today). I watched one of his beginner tutorials on game development and felt excited. He explained everything so well that I thought, “This doesn’t seem too hard. I can do this.”\n\nBut by the end of the video, he said something that shocked me: “To build your own game, you’ll need to learn a programming language.” \n\nI froze. “What the hell is this?” I thought. I searched about programming languages online and saw code for the first time in my life—it looked like some alien language with symbols, numbers, and colorful syntax. I immediately shut the laptop and felt completely demotivated. That was my *first* encounter with programming.\n\nBut I didn’t stop there. A few days later, I started searching again—this time for ways to create games *without* programming. I found dozens of videos about game engines that let you make games with no code at all. But after watching more and more, I realized a hard truth: You can’t create your own algorithms or unique mechanics without coding. Those no-code tools were just limited templates. \n\nNow, one thing you should know about me—I’m a super lazy person. I didn’t want to learn this alien language. I spent hours upon hours trying to find a way around it. I researched hundreds of game engines that promised easy game creation. And sure, I found some—but they were either limited or expensive, especially if you wanted to build more complex features.\n\nOne day, I shared all this frustration with my brother. He listened and then simply said, “Why don’t you just learn programming?” He motivated me, and for the first time, I really considered it. I searched, “Which programming language should I learn first to create games?”\n\nAlmost everywhere, the answer was the same: **C++ is the best language for game development.**\n\n(HEY YOU KNOW WHAT—I’M GONNA STOP WRITING THIS POST HERE BECAUSE MY LAPTOP IS ACTING LIKE IT’S ABOUT TO EXPLODE. IT’S LAGGING BADLY, SO I’LL CONTINUE THIS STORY IN ANOTHER POST!)"
