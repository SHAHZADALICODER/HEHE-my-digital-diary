        content: `Hello! My name is Shahzad Ali — born on June 20, 2008 — and I’m turning 17 this year. Online, many people know me as “Shazzu” — especially in communities like Roblox, Discord, and other places where I’ve built and explored creative worlds.

This blog is my digital space. A place to write freely, think deeply, and store the thoughts I’m often too shy to say out loud. I’ve gone through a lot of internal changes recently — not just growing physically, but emotionally too. The way I look at the world, relationships, my future, and even myself has been evolving.

I’m a self-taught developer, filmmaker, storyteller, and someone who deeply believes in creativity. But at the same time, I’m also navigating the pressure of school, family expectations, and figuring out my true purpose.

This blog is not just for others — it’s also for my future self. A place to leave traces of how I felt, what I learned, and what I dreamed at this stage of my life. Whether I’m talking about deep emotions, coding, game design, or random midnight thoughts — it all belongs here.

Welcome to my mind. Welcome to HEHEHE: My digital diary. (System detected : Need to be updated)`,

        content: `I started this blog to have a space where I can express myself freely. In a world where social media often feels like a performance, I wanted a place that’s just mine. A place to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences without the pressure of likes or followers.

        This is my own digital diary, where I can write about anything that comes to mind. Whether it’s about coding, game design, personal growth, or just random thoughts, this blog is my sanctuary. It’s a space where I can be myself, reflect on my journey, and connect with others who might feel the same way.
        I also wanted to document my growth and changes over time. As I navigate through life, I find that writing helps me process my thoughts and emotions. It’s a way to understand myself better and to keep track of my journey.
        I believe that writing helps me understand myself better. It’s a way to process my thoughts and emotions, and to document my growth. This blog is not just for me, but also for anyone who might find comfort or inspiration in my words. I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can connect with others who are on similar journeys.`,

        title: "Nowdays.",
        content: `These days, I feel like I'm completely cooked -- like my soul is being slowly roasted by life itself. Not burned suddenly, but simmered quietly, one painful moment at a time. And I'm just sitting in it, watching it happen, knowing I can't explain this feeling to anyone in my family or around me -- not in a way they'd understand.

It started when I failed my recent entrance exam. Someone junior to me -- not by age, but by class -- got selected. It broke me a little inside. I was the one who used to rank highest in my earlier school years. I was the one who made my family's expectations climb sky-high. But since Class 9, I feel like I've been falling constantly, and no one really sees how far I've fallen -- not even me sometimes.

It's been year after year of pressure. Class 9, then a 9th-grade entrance test. Then 10th board exams, followed by the 11th entrance test, then intermediate first year, then another entrance again -- and now, 12th is knocking on my door. The pressure has been nonstop, but what's more painful is that I haven't been able to meet my family's expectations in any of these years.

I know what they think now. They don't have to say it. The way they look at me, the way they speak to me -- I feel it. And it stings harder than words.

I'm a sensitive person. Even the smallest comment can stay with me for days. But I've learned to hide it. Because if I show pain, I'll hear things like:
"You're crying like a kid? Grow up already!"

So, I just take it in quietly.

There's someone in my family who thinks he can read minds. He'll ask questions that sound innocent, like "What's 5 + 5?", but his actual intention feels like something else entirely -- like he's silently judging me through trick questions. It's hard to explain, but it makes me feel small.

I gave the 11th entrance exam twice. Failed both times. Wasn't selected. That still hits deep. And today, someone from that room where I used to live while preparing for that exam -- not from my old class, just another student like me -- came to my village and called me to meet.

But whenever someone from that phase of my life calls me, I get this weird fear. It's not about them -- it's about the environment they bring with them. The rough tone, the abusive jokes, the way you're expected to talk like them to prove you belong. I can't do that naturally. I don't even know how to speak like that in my own language. I used to force myself to match their vibe, but not anymore. I've decided -- if someone's energy matches mine, I can talk with them all day and night. But I'm done pretending just to be accepted.

I'm the youngest in my family -- the youngest brother among all my siblings. I'm 17 now, but I don't even get the basic respect that a 14-year-old deserves.

If I try to do something by myself, they say:
"You don't have the brain for this, why did you even try?"

If I wait for their instructions instead, they say:
"You can't even think for yourself?"

So what exactly am I supposed to do? Everything I do seems wrong, no matter how I approach it.

Lately, something strange has started happening almost every midnight -- around 12 to 1 AM. I suddenly feel like I've lost something... but I don't even know what. It makes me feel like crying, but I don't know why. My mind starts playing back every painful moment I've ever had -- the times I felt humiliated, embarrassed, hurt -- like a cursed playlist on repeat.

And then, there's my body. I'm not very handsome, I know. I'm overweight, and people feel the need to remind me of it daily.

"What are you eating these days?" they laugh.
I laugh too, but inside, I feel broken. I didn't ask for this body. And I surely didn't ask to be judged by it every day.

I have dark skin too. And sometimes, I avoid laughing in front of people. Because when I look at myself laughing in the mirror, my face feels... weird. Like a dried egg or something. Not in a funny way -- in a way that makes me feel like others will find me disgusting if I smile too wide. So, I try to stay quiet. I don't want anyone to think I'm mocking them or being weird.

Outside of my family, even when I know people, I can't talk to them freely. My vibe is just different. People expect you to talk like a "cool" guy, using bad words in casual conversation like it's a language. I can't fake that anymore. I don't want to.

Once, I overheard my mother telling her sister:
"He has no heart."
Maybe she said it because I fight with my siblings, or I raise my voice sometimes. But I do have a heart. I feel deeply. I feel things that maybe no one even notices. And it hurts knowing that my own mother might not see that.

Another time, my brother asked me:
"If you were lost in a jungle with some children and found an apple, would you eat it first or feed them first?"
I don't know what he was trying to test. Did he really think I don't care about others?

Sometimes I feel like my family has built an image of me in their minds that I don't even recognize. I don't know who they think I am. But it's not me.

And all of this -- the pressure, the judgments, the loneliness, the unspoken pain -- it has started to feel like depression. I know what's causing it, but it still feels heavier than what those reasons should normally feel like. It's like I'm carrying more weight than I'm built for.

I'm not writing this to act cool or look like some tragic character. I'm not writing this for sympathy or attention. I'm not the saddest person in the world -- and I know that. I'm just trying to say honestly what I'm feeling these days. That's it.

My Urdu teacher once told us:
"When you write down your pain, it absorbs some of the weight. Some of the pain stays on the page instead of in your heart."

I didn't believe that at first. But I tried it.

And it helped.

That's why I'm writing this on my blog. Not to impress anyone. Not to make anyone feel sorry for me. Just to speak honestly. To let it out. To give some peace to the mind that stays awake every night, haunted by the past.

I've written everything I feel these days. Maybe I'll change or add something later. But for now, I'm going to publish this on my blog and wait for my future self to read it. I don't know who I'll be then -- but I hope that version of me is doing better than the one writing this today.`
